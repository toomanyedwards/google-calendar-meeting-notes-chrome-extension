# Development

This extension is based off Create React App (CRA). The project is ejected from CRA so that output file names remain the same and can be referenced by name in the manifest.json. Note: There may be a better way to this without ejecting from CRA. 

:warning: This project is *very* quick and dirty so the code is currently ugly and not optimized. Also, it isn't currently even using react.
